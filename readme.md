# About this code
PQ is an evaluation value which is defined in the panoptic segmentation.  
For the further imformation about the panoptic segmentation,   
see the following link, "https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00868".  
This code calculate PQ between prediction and ground truth data.  
Excecute as following,
```python:PQ.py
	python PQ.py <pred_dir> <gt_dir> <log.txt>
```
